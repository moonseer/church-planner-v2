# Church Planner v2 - Prioritized Recommendations

## Critical Issues (Immediate Action Required)

1. **Fix Swagger Documentation**
   - The Swagger documentation UI is not loading at `/api/docs`
   - Investigate and fix the issue to ensure API documentation is accessible
   - Verify that API route files are properly annotated with JSDoc comments
   - Check path patterns in the swagger.ts configuration

2. **Address Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Replace localStorage token storage with HTTP-only cookies
   - Implement CSRF protection for API endpoints
   - Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints
   - Implement proper password policies (complexity, expiration, etc.)

3. **Fix Test Failures**
   - Address reference errors in client.test.ts
   - Fix React hook usage in useAuth.test.ts
   - Resolve promise issues in main.test.tsx
   - Fix timer-related issues in monitoring.test.ts

4. **Verify Containerized Application**
   - Confirm both client and server applications are accessible in containers
   - Ensure proper network configuration for inter-container communication
   - Verify that volume mounts are correctly configured for development

## High Priority (Next Sprint)

1. **Improve Test Coverage**
   - Increase test coverage to meet the target of 70%
   - Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows
   - Add visual regression testing

2. **Enhance Frontend Development**
   - Complete design system implementation
   - Make dashboard components fully customizable
   - Improve accessibility compliance
   - Implement user onboarding

3. **Replace Mock Data with Database Integration**
   - Ensure all client-side components use data from the API
   - Remove any hardcoded mock data
   - Implement proper error handling for API requests

4. **Implement Comprehensive Error Handling**
   - Add global error boundary for React components
   - Implement consistent error handling patterns across the application
   - Add user-friendly error messages

## Medium Priority (Upcoming Sprints)

1. **Improve Containerization**
   - Set up container orchestration for production
   - Implement automated container builds in CI/CD
   - Configure container resource limits and scaling policies

2. **Enhance Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive style guide
   - Document accessibility features
   - Set up automated documentation generation
   - Create architecture diagrams and system overview

3. **Optimize Mobile Experience**
   - Create responsive design for all components
   - Implement mobile-specific navigation
   - Optimize touch targets and interactions

4. **Implement Advanced Features**
   - Start work on volunteer management
   - Begin implementing song library features
   - Create team communication foundation

## Low Priority (Backlog)

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement lazy loading for components
   - Add code splitting
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement caching strategies

2. **Advanced Integration Features**
   - Calendar integration (Google, iCal)
   - Media integration (ProPresenter, etc.)
   - Webhooks for external services

3. **Reporting & Analytics**
   - Design reporting dashboard
   - Implement service statistics
   - Create volunteer participation reports
   - Add song usage analytics

4. **Multi-Church Support**
   - Implement multi-tenancy features
   - Add church-specific customization options
   - Create hierarchy of permissions for multi-church management

## Maintenance & Technical Debt

1. **Dependency Updates**
   - Regularly update dependencies to ensure security
   - Address any deprecation warnings
   - Update TypeScript to the latest version

2. **Code Refactoring**
   - Extract duplicate code into shared utilities
   - Create consistent patterns for common operations
   - Implement better separation of concerns

3. **Documentation Maintenance**
   - Keep API documentation up to date
   - Update README with new features and changes
   - Maintain changelog for version tracking

4. **Infrastructure Maintenance**
   - Regularly update Docker images
   - Review and update monitoring configurations
   - Maintain CI/CD pipeline configuration
