## Issue Analysis

### Swagger Documentation Not Loading

The Swagger UI is not accessible at the configured endpoint `/api/docs`. The server is configured correctly in `server/src/config/swagger.ts` to serve Swagger UI at this endpoint, but it's not responding. This could be due to:

1. Incorrect path patterns in the Swagger configuration
2. Missing route documentation in API files
3. Potentially a conflict with other middleware

### Test Failures

Several test files have issues that need to be addressed:

1. `client.test.ts` - Reference errors related to hoisting of mock functions
2. `useAuth.test.ts` - Issues with React hooks outside of component context
3. `main.test.tsx` - Promise resolution issues
4. `monitoring.test.ts` - Timer-related issues

### Critical Security Issues

The application has several critical security issues:

1. Using localStorage for token storage instead of HTTP-only cookies
2. Lack of CSRF protection for API endpoints
3. No rate limiting for authentication endpoints
4. No proper password policies

## Recommendations

### High Priority (Immediate Action)

1. **Fix Critical Security Issues**:
   - Replace localStorage token storage with HTTP-only cookies
   - Implement CSRF protection for API endpoints
   - Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints
   - Implement proper password policies

2. **Fix Swagger Documentation**:
   - Investigate why Swagger UI is not loading at `/api/docs`
   - Verify that API route files are properly annotated with JSDoc comments
   - Check path patterns in swagger.ts configuration

3. **Fix Test Failures**:
   - Address reference errors in client.test.ts
   - Fix React hook usage in useAuth.test.ts
   - Resolve promise issues in main.test.tsx
   - Fix timer-related issues in monitoring.test.ts

### Medium Priority (Next Sprint)

1. **Improve Test Coverage**:
   - Increase test coverage to meet the target of 70%
   - Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows
   - Add visual regression testing

2. **Enhance Frontend Development**:
   - Complete design system implementation
   - Make dashboard components fully customizable
   - Improve accessibility compliance
   - Implement user onboarding
   - Optimize mobile experience

3. **Improve Containerization**:
   - Set up container orchestration for production
   - Implement automated container builds in CI/CD
   - Configure container resource limits and scaling policies

### Low Priority (Backlog)

1. **Implement Advanced Features**:
   - Volunteer management
   - Song library
   - Team communication
   - Reporting & analytics
   - Integration & API

2. **Enhance Documentation**:
   - Create comprehensive style guide
   - Document accessibility features
   - Set up automated documentation generation
   - Create architecture diagrams and system overview

3. **Optimize Performance**:
   - Implement lazy loading for components
   - Add code splitting
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement caching strategies

## Conclusion

The Church Planner v2 project has made significant progress in implementing core infrastructure, authentication, and basic functionality. However, there are several critical issues that need to be addressed, particularly related to security, testing, and documentation. By prioritizing these issues and implementing the recommendations outlined in this report, the project can be brought to a production-ready state.

The most urgent issues to address are the critical security vulnerabilities, the non-functioning Swagger documentation, and the failing tests. Once these are resolved, focus should shift to improving test coverage and enhancing the frontend experience.

## Next Steps

1. Create tickets for all high-priority issues
2. Assign resources to address critical security vulnerabilities
3. Implement fixes for Swagger documentation and failing tests
4. Develop a plan for addressing medium and low-priority issues in future sprints
