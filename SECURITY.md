# Security Improvements

## HTTP-Only Cookies

Replaced localStorage token storage with HTTP-only cookies for improved security against XSS attacks.

- Updated authentication controllers to set tokens in HTTP-only cookies
- Removed token from response bodies
- Updated client API to use credentials in all requests
- Updated authentication middleware to only use cookies for token retrieval

## JWT Secret Management

Implemented secure JWT secret handling with environment variables and production safeguards.

- Added checks for JWT_SECRET environment variable
- Added warnings when using fallback secrets
- Implemented strict enforcement in production environments
- Removed hardcoded JWT secrets

## Rate Limiting

Added rate limiting to authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks.

- Implemented rate limiting for /login and /register endpoints
- Configured limits based on environment variables
- Added clear error messages for rate-limited requests

## CSRF Protection

Implemented CSRF protection for API endpoints with token validation.

- Added CSRF middleware to protect routes
- Created CSRF token endpoint for client applications
- Updated client to include CSRF tokens in requests
- Excluded authentication endpoints from CSRF protection for initial login

## HTTPS Implementation

Implemented secure HTTPS for production environments.

- Added HTTP to HTTPS redirection middleware
- Configured HTTPS server with SSL/TLS certificates
- Added fallback handling when certificates are unavailable
- Created documentation for generating and using SSL certificates
- Updated CORS configuration to work with HTTPS

## Secure Cookie Configuration

Enhanced cookie security for better protection against various attacks.

- Set the `secure` flag in production environments
- Implemented `sameSite` policies
- Configured proper cookie expiration
- Added HTTP-only flag to prevent JavaScript access

## Password Policy

Implemented strong password requirements to enhance account security.

- Added minimum length requirement (8 characters)
- Required password complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
- Created custom validation logic for password strength
- Added documentation on password requirements for users

## Account Locking

Implemented account locking mechanism to prevent brute force attacks.

- Added tracking of login attempts
- Implemented automatic account locking after 5 failed attempts
- Set 15-minute lockout duration for security
- Added user-friendly error messages with remaining lockout time

## Security Headers

Added security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

- Set X-Content-Type-Options to prevent MIME-sniffing
- Configured X-Frame-Options to protect against clickjacking
- Enabled X-XSS-Protection for additional XSS prevention
- Added Permissions-Policy to control browser feature usage
- Implemented Content Security Policy in production
- Removed X-Powered-By header to reduce information disclosure

## Testing Your Security Setup

To verify the security improvements, ensure:

1. Authentication works correctly with HTTP-only cookies
2. CSRF protection prevents cross-site requests
3. Rate limiting effectively blocks too many attempts
4. HTTPS redirects work in production mode
5. JWT secrets are properly secured via environment variables
6. Password validation enforces the required complexity
7. Account locking activates after multiple failed login attempts

## Next Steps

- Implement password expiration and history tracking
- Implement multi-factor authentication
- Add IP-based suspicious activity detection
- Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Add more granular user permissions system
