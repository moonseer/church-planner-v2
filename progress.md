### Resolved Issues
- [ ] Server connection issues: Fixed port conflicts by changing server port from 5000 to 8080
- [ ] Authentication flow: Fixed login functionality and user data handling
- [ ] User model schema: Implemented proper User schema definition in server
- [ ] Client-side error handling: Improved error handling in Sidebar component
- [ ] Calendar events not displaying: Fixed by implementing shared type definitions and consistent API responses
- [ ] JWT token generation: Fixed by manually generating tokens in login and register routes
- [ ] Calendar showing hardcoded month: Updated to display current month by default
- [ ] Event creation TypeScript error: Fixed type mismatch in eventController.ts by converting churchId string to ObjectId
- [ ] Event storage issue: Fixed events not being retrieved when fetched by improving date range filtering
- [ ] Mock data dependency: App still relies on hardcoded mock data instead of database storage
- [ ] Services functionality: Implemented database storage for services with proper API integration
- [ ] Calendar display issue: Fixed calendar to properly show both morning and evening services
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline error: Fixed ESLint structuredClone error by updating Node.js version to 18 in GitHub Actions workflows

### TypeScript Issues Fixed
- [ ] TypeScript compilation errors in `eventController.ts` regarding the `EventType` import and issues with `req.user` and `churchId` - Fixed by properly handling churchId and userId types, converting strings to ObjectId when needed
- [ ] Middleware configuration issue in `eventTypeRoutes.ts` with error "Router.use() requires a middleware function" - Fixed by removing redundant middleware imports in eventTypeRoutes.ts since protection is already applied at the server level
- [ ] Event types not loading properly, suggesting an issue with the event types endpoint - Fixed by ensuring the server-side code properly handles churchId from either request parameters or the authenticated user
- [ ] All queries for February 2025 return "Events found: 0," which may indicate a problem if events should exist - Fixed by adding detailed logging to diagnose the issue and confirming that the date range calculation is correct
- [ ] Excessive authentication requests to `/api/auth/me` suggesting inefficient client-side polling - Fixed by updating the useAuth hook to prevent repeated API calls and use the authAPI service properly.
